      <description>Summary: (1) Philippine stocks doest not seem to follow standard factor literature as high multiples and high volatility stocks outperform their bottom quintile counterparts. (2) Momentum and size factors seem to work on Philippine stocks, with the latter generating the best annual rolling returns post-GFC. Size factor also seems to provide the best return after a market lull/downturn. (3) Standard factors in the Philippines does not seem to provide good portfolio diversification given the high correlation between strategies.</description>

      <description>With the benefit of hindsight, I have seen some seasonality patterns in NatGas that seemed to generate decent returns after mannualy checking the charts. However, I havenâ€™t really done any work before to test if those patterns held up consistently in the past. NatGas typically rallies during the fourth quarter as demand perks up due to winter season, followed up by lower prices as demand eases up during the after the winter season.</description>
