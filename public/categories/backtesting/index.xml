      <description>Both models have shown their capability to outperform depending on liquity and market cap requirements. Adopting a more conservative approach where we only invest in names that has an average turnover value of PhP20.0mn and a maximum market cap of PhP75.0bn ties total performance of both models as of end-2015 and as of May 10, 2019.
This actually boils down to which strategy has the lowest median drawdown, of which the Momentum model takes the cake.</description>

      <description>Running a factor model on listed names in the Philippine Stock Market shows that Size, Momentum, Beta factors work as intended. Meanwhile, factors including Value, Volatility, Quality, and TP revisions factors in the local market contradicted what is in the books. This could just be a function of rebalancing period but I’ll reserve that exercise for another day.{&#34;x&#34;:{&#34;visdat&#34;:{&#34;2a0c651d3544&#34;:[&#34;function () &#34;,&#34;plotlyVisDat&#34;]},&#34;cur_data&#34;:&#34;2a0c651d3544&#34;,&#34;attrs&#34;:{&#34;2a0c651d3544&#34;:{&#34;x&#34;:{},&#34;showlegend&#34;:false,&#34;color&#34;:{},&#34;colors&#34;:[&#34;#a6cee3&#34;,&#34;#1f78b4&#34;,&#34;#b2df8a&#34;,&#34;#33a02c&#34;,&#34;#fb9a99&#34;,&#34;#e31a1c&#34;,&#34;#fdbf6f&#34;,&#34;#ff7f00&#34;,&#34;#cab2d6&#34;,&#34;#6a3d9a&#34;,&#34;#ffff99&#34;,&#34;#b15928&#34;],&#34;alpha_stroke&#34;:1,&#34;sizes&#34;:[10,100],&#34;spans&#34;:[1,20],&#34;type&#34;:&#34;box&#34;}},&#34;layout&#34;:{&#34;margin&#34;:{&#34;b&#34;:40,&#34;l&#34;:60,&#34;t&#34;:25,&#34;r&#34;:10},&#34;annotations&#34;:[{&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Bottom Quintile Outperforms&#34;</description>

      <title>Seasonality trading with NatGas</title>

      <description>With the benefit of hindsight, I have seen some seasonality patterns in NatGas that seemed to generate decent returns after mannualy checking the charts. However, I haven’t really done any work before to test if those patterns held up consistently in the past. NatGas typically rallies during the fourth quarter as demand perks up due to winter season, followed up by lower prices as demand eases up during the after the winter season.</description>
