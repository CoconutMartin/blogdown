      <description>Running a factor model on listed names in the Philippine Stock Market shows that Size, Momentum, Beta factors work as intended. Meanwhile, factors including Value, Volatility, Quality, and TP revisions factors in the local market contradicted what is in the books. This could just be a function of rebalancing period but I’ll reserve that exercise for another day.## Warning: Ignoring 191 observations## Warning: The titlefont attribute is deprecated.</description>

      <description>With the benefit of hindsight, I have seen some seasonality patterns in NatGas that seemed to generate decent returns after mannualy checking the charts. However, I haven’t really done any work before to test if those patterns held up consistently in the past. NatGas typically rallies during the fourth quarter as demand perks up due to winter season, followed up by lower prices as demand eases up during the after the winter season.</description>
